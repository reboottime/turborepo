# Login Page — E2E Tests

Tests generated by the Playwright AI agent pipeline (Planner > Generator > Healer).

## Known Issue: Mixed Test Scopes

Some tests here are unit/component-test scope (e.g., checking ARIA attributes, label visibility, individual input behavior). These were included because the AI agent generates all tests at the E2E layer. They should be migrated to unit tests (Jest + RTL) where they run faster and give better feedback.

**Belongs in E2E:** Full login flows — successful login with redirect, auth error handling, session persistence.

**Belongs in unit tests:** Component rendering, ARIA attributes, tab order, button disabled states, password visibility toggle, form validation messages.
