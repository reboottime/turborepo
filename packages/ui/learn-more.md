## Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of Nielsen Norman Group, established these principles in 1994. They remain the industry standard for UI design.

| #   | Heuristic                               | Application in this Design System                               |
| --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Visibility of system status**         | Loading states, button disabled states, select chevron rotation |
| 2   | **Match between system and real world** | Familiar patterns, clear labels                                 |
| 3   | **User control and freedom**            | Dialog close buttons, form reset options                        |
| 4   | **Consistency and standards**           | Shared tokens, predictable component APIs                       |
| 5   | **Error prevention**                    | Form validation, disabled states for invalid actions            |
| 6   | **Recognition over recall**             | Visible options in selects, clear iconography                   |
| 7   | **Flexibility and efficiency**          | Keyboard navigation, focus management                           |
| 8   | **Aesthetic and minimalist design**     | Clean components, purposeful whitespace                         |
| 9   | **Help users recover from errors**      | Error variants with clear messaging                             |
| 10  | **Help and documentation**              | Storybook stories, component docs                               |
